  title = {Ambiguity in {{Categorical Models}} of {{Meaning}}},
  abstract = {Abstract Building on existing categorical accounts of natural language semantics, we propose a compositional distributional model of ambiguous meaning. Originally inspired by the high-level category theoretic language of quantum information protocols, the compositional, distributional categorical model provides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of a sentence, given its grammatical structure and an empirical derivation of the meaning of its parts. Grammar is given a type-logical description in a compact closed category while the meaning of words is represented in a finite inner product space model. Since the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces is also compact closed, the type-checking deduction process lifts to a concrete meaning-vector computation via a strong monoidal functor between the two categories. The advantage of reasoning with these structures is that grammatical composition admits an interpretation in terms of flow of meaning between words. Pushing the analogy with quantum mechanics further, we describe ambiguous words as statistical ensembles of unambiguous concepts and extend the semantics of the previous model to a category that supports probabilistic mixing. We introduce two different Frobenius algebras representing different ways of composing the meaning of words, and discuss their properties. We conclude with a range of applications to the case of definitions, including a meaning update rule that reconciles the meaning of an ambiguous word with that of its definition.},

  doi = {10.4230/LIPIcs.CALCO.2015.270},
  abstract = {Originally inspired by categorical quantum mechanics (Abramsky and Coecke, LiCS'04), the categorical compositional distributional model of natural language meaning of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark provides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of a sentence, given its grammatical structure within a Lambek pregroup and a vectorial representation of the meaning of its parts. Moreover, just like CQM allows for varying the model in which we interpret quantum axioms, one can also vary the model in which we interpret word meaning.

In this paper we show that further developments in categorical quantum mechanics are relevant to natural language processing too. Firstly, Selinger's CPM-construction allows for explicitly taking into account lexical ambiguity and distinguishing between the two inherently different notions of homonymy and polysemy. In terms of the model in which we interpret word meaning, this means a passage from the vector space model to density matrices. Despite this change of model, standard empirical methods for comparing meanings can be easily adopted, which we demonstrate by a small-scale experiment on real-world data. Secondly, commutative classical structures as well as their non-commutative counterparts that arise in the image of the CPM-construction allow for encoding relative pronouns, verbs and adjectives, and finally, iteration of the CPM-construction, something that has no counterpart in the quantum realm, enables one to accommodate both entailment and ambiguity.},

  title = {From {{Distributional}} to {{Semantic Similarity}}},
  url = {http://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/563},
  abstract = {Lexical-semantic resources, including thesauri and WORDNET, have been successfully incor- porated into a wide range of applications in Natural Language Processing. However they are very difficult and expensive to create and maintain, and their usefulness has been severely hampered by their limited coverage, bias and inconsistency. Automated and semi-automated methods for developing such resources are therefore crucial for further resource development and improved application performance. Systems that extract thesauri often identify similar words using the distributional hypothesis that similar words appear in similar contexts. This approach involves using corpora to examine the contexts each word appears in and then calculating the similarity between context distributions. Different definitions of context can be used, and I begin by examining how different types of extracted context influence similarity. To be of most benefit these systems must be capable of finding synonyms for rare words. Reliable context counts for rare events can only be extracted from vast collections of text. In this dissertation I describe how to extract contexts from a corpus of over 2 billion words. I describe techniques for processing text on this scale and examine the trade-off between context accuracy, information content and quantity of text analysed. Distributional similarity is at best an approximation to semantic similarity. I develop improved approximations motivated by the intuition that some events in the context distribution are more indicative of meaning than others. For instance, the object-of-verb context wear is far more indicative of a clothing noun than get. However, existing distributional techniques do not effectively utilise this information. The new context-weighted similarity metric I propose in this dissertation significantly outperforms every distributional similarity metric described in the literature. Nearest-neighbour similarity algorithms scale poorly with vocabulary and context vector size. To overcome this problem I introduce a new context-weighted approximation algorithm with bounded complexity in context vector size that significantly reduces the system runtime with only a minor performance penalty. I also describe a parallelized version of the system that runs on a Beowulf cluster for the 2 billion word experiments. To evaluate the context-weighted similarity measure I compare ranked similarity lists against gold-standard resources using precision and recall-based measures from Information Retrieval, since the alternative, application-based evaluation, can often be influenced by distributional as well as semantic similarity. I also perform a detailed analysis of the final results using WORDNET. Finally, I apply my similarity metric to the task of assigning words to WORDNET semantic categories. I demonstrate that this new approach outperforms existing methods and overcomes some of their weaknesses.},

Our main focus will be on monoidal categories, mostly symmetric ones, for which we propose a physical interpretation. These are particularly relevant for quantum foundations and for quantum informatics. Special attention is given to the category which has finite dimensional Hilbert spaces as objects, linear maps as morphisms, and the tensor product as its monoidal structure (FdHilb). We also provide a detailed discussion of the category which has sets as objects, relations as morphisms, and the cartesian product as its monoidal structure (Rel), and thirdly, categories with manifolds as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms (2Cob). While sets, Hilbert spaces and manifolds do not share any non-trivial common structure, these three categories are in fact structurally very similar. Shared features are diagrammatic calculus, compact closed structure and particular kinds of internal comonoids which play an important role in each of them. The categories FdHilb and Rel moreover admit a categorical matrix calculus. Together these features guide us towards topological quantum field theories. We also discuss posetal categories, how group representations are in fact categorical constructs, and what strictification and coherence of monoidal categories is all about. In our attempt to complement the existing literature we omitted some very basic topics. For these we refer the reader to other available sources.},

  abstract = {The Distributional Compositional Categorical (DisCoCat) model is a mathematical framework that provides compositional semantics for meanings of natural language sentences. It consists of a computational procedure for constructing meanings of sentences, given their grammatical structure in terms of compositional type-logic, and given the empirically derived meanings of their words. For the particular case that the meaning of words is modelled within a distributional vector space model, its experimental predictions, derived from real large scale data, have outperformed other empirically validated methods that could build vectors for a full sentence. This success can be attributed to a conceptually motivated mathematical underpinning, by integrating qualitative compositional type-logic and quantitative modelling of meaning within a category-theoretic mathematical framework. The type-logic used in the DisCoCat model is Lambek's pregroup grammar. Pregroup types form a posetal compact closed category, which can be passed, in a functorial manner, on to the compact closed structure of vector spaces, linear maps and tensor product. The diagrammatic versions of the equational reasoning in compact closed categories can be interpreted as the flow of word meanings within sentences. Pregroups simplify Lambek's previous type-logic, the Lambek calculus, which has been extensively used to formalise and reason about various linguistic phenomena. The apparent reliance of the DisCoCat on pregroups has been seen as a shortcoming. This paper addresses this concern, by pointing out that one may as well realise a functorial passage from the original type-logic of Lambek, a monoidal bi-closed category, to vector spaces, or to any other model of meaning organised within a monoidal bi-closed category. The corresponding string diagram calculus, due to Baez and Stay, now depicts the flow of word meanings.},

When addressing a new problem domain, such as conceptual space models of meaning, a key problem is finding a compact closed category that captures the features of interest.We propose categories of generalized relations as a source of new, practical models for cognition and NLP. We demonstrate using detailed examples that phenomena such as fuzziness, metrics, convexity, semantic ambiguity can all be described by relational models. Crucially, by exploiting a technical framework described in previous work of the authors, we also show how the above-mentioned phenomena can be combined into a single model, providing a flexible family of new categories for categorical compositional modelling.},

  abstract = {We propose a mathematical framework for a unification of the distributional theory of meaning in terms of vector space models, and a compositional theory for grammatical types, namely Lambek's pregroup semantics. A key observation is that the monoidal category of (finite dimensional) vector spaces, linear maps and the tensor product, as well as any pregroup, are examples of compact closed categories. Since, by definition, a pregroup is a compact closed category with trivial morphisms, its compositional content is reflected within the compositional structure of any non-degenerate compact closed category. The (slightly refined) category of vector spaces enables us to compute the meaning of a compound well-typed sentence from the meaning of its constituents, by `lifting' the type reduction mechanisms of pregroup semantics to the whole category. These sentence meanings live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence we can use the inner-product to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences. A variation of this procedure which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the semiring of Booleans results in the well-known Montague semantics.},

Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ("colored coins"), the ownership of an underlying physical device ("smart property"), non-fungible assets such as domain names ("Namecoin"), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules ("smart contracts") or even blockchain-based "decentralized autonomous organizations" (DAOs). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

  abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality :aword sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

We then show how to construct conceptual spaces for various types such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. Finally we show by means of examples how concepts can be systematically combined to establish the meanings of composite phrases from the meanings of their constituent parts.

This text is not intended to be encyclopedic; rather, a few themes central to universal algebra have been developed sufficiently to bring the reader to the brink of current research. The choice of topics most certainly reflects the authors' interests. Chapter I contains a brief but substantial introduction to lattices, and to the close connection between complete lattices and closure operators. In particular, everything necessary for the subsequent study of congruence lattices is included. Chapter II develops the most general and fundamental notions of uni\- versal algebra-these include the results that apply to all types of algebras, such as the homomorphism and isomorphism theorems. Free algebras are discussed in great detail-we use them to derive the existence of simple algebras, the rules of equational logic, and the important Mal'cev conditions. We introduce the notion of classifying a variety by properties of (the lattices of) congruences on members of the variety. Also, the center of an algebra is defined and used to characterize modules (up to polynomial equivalence). In Chapter III we show how neatly two famous results-the refutation of Euler's conjecture on orthogonal Latin squares and Kleene's character\- ization of languages accepted by finite automata-can be presented using universal algebra. We predict that such "applied universal algebra" will become much more prominent.},

In this approach, signal flow graphs are given a relational denotational semantics in terms of formal power series. Thus far, the operational behaviour of such signal flow graphs has only been discussed at an intuitive level. In this paper we equip them with a structural operational semantics. As is typically the case, the purely operational picture is too concrete -- two graphs that are denotationally equal may exhibit different operational behaviour. We classify the ways in which this can occur and show that any graph can be realised -- rewritten, using the graphical theory, into an executable form where the operational behavior and the denotation coincides.},

  abstract = {This chapter highlights the historical development of Montague grammar as both narrowly and broadly construed, with particular attention to the key ideas that led Montague's work to have such a great impact on subsequent developments. Contemporary formal semantics has roots in several disciplines, most importantly logic, philosophy, and linguistics. The central figure in its recent history was Richard Montague, a logician and philosopher whose seminal works in this area date from the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. But Montague's work did not occur in a vacuum, and the development of "Montague grammar" and of formal semantics more generally, has involved contributions from many sources before, during, and after Montague's work. The paper of Montague that had the most impact on linguists and on the subsequent development of formal semantics in general, was PTQ: 24 pages long, but densely packed. To many, "Montague Grammar" has probably meant what Montague did in the fragment in PTQ and the extensions of PTQ by subsequent linguists and philosophers with greater and lesser innovations, but it is the broader algebraic framework of "Universal Grammar" (UG) that constitutes Montague's theory of grammar. Montague's paper "Universal Grammar" contains the most general statement of Montague's formal framework for the description of language. The central idea is that anything that should count as a grammar should be able to be cast in the following form: The syntax is an algebra; the semantics is an algebra; and there is a homomorphism mapping elements of the syntactic algebra onto elements of the semantic algebra. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This book sets out the foundations, methodology, and practice of a formal framework for the description of language. The approach embraces the trends of lexicalism and compositional semantics in computational linguistics, and theoretical linguistics more broadly, by developing categorial grammar into a powerful and extendable logic of signs. Taking Montague Grammar as its point of departure, the book explains how integration of methods from philosophy (logical semantics), computer science (type theory), linguistics (categorial grammar) and meta-mathematics (mathematical logic ) provides a categorial foundation with coverage including intensionality, quantification, featural polymorphism, domains and constraints. For the first time, the book systematises categorial thinking into a unified program which is at once both logically secured, and a practical tool for pure lexical grammar development with type-theoretic semantics. It should be of interest to all those active in computational linguistics and formal grammar and is suitable for use at advanced undergraduate, postgraduate, and research levels.},

The hybrid architectures aiming for an integration of ideas from unification grammars and categorial systems seem to have disappeared from the scene. A marked trend, in general, is the move to leaner syntactic calculi, by exchanging structural rules for richer algebraic models, or by introducing more structure in the interpreting semantic calculi. The excerpt taken from 1997 edition retains the core materials of the chapter: the discussion of the "classical" Lambek systems, the Curry-Howard perspective on the syntax-semantics interface, and the development of multimodal architectures. The central objective of the type-logical approach is to develop a uniform deductive account of the composition of form and meaning in natural language: Formal grammar is presented as logic-a system for reasoning about structured linguistic resources. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Osherson and Smith (1981, Cognition, 11, 237-262) discuss a number of problems which arise for a prototype-based account of the meanings of simple and complex concepts. Assuming that concept combination in such a theory is to be analyzed in terms of fuzzy logic, they show that some complex concepts inevitably get assigned the wrong meanings. In the present paper we argue that many of the problems O\&S discovered are due to difficulties that are intrinsic to fuzzy set theory, and that most of them disappear when fuzzy logic is replaced by supervaluation theory. However, even after this replacement one of O\&S's central problems remains: the theory still predicts that the degree to which an object is an instance of, say, "striped apple" must be less than or equal to both the degree to which it is an instance of "striped" and the degree to which it is an instance of "apple", but this constraint conflicts with O\&S's experimental results. The second part of the paper explores ways of solving this and related problems. This leads us to suggest a number of distinctions and principles concerning how prototypicality and other mechanisms interact and which seem important for semantics generally. Prominent among these are (i) the distinction between on the one hand the logical and semantic properties of concepts and on the other the linguistic that between concepts for which the extension is determined by their prototype and concepts for which extension and prototypicality are independent. ?? 1995.},

At the same time, it has become apparent that these formulations can be extended and deepened.The major purpose of this book is to review these developments and to propose a reformulation of the theory of transformational generative grammar that takes them into account. The emphasis in this study is syntax; semantic and phonological aspects of the language structure are discussed only insofar as they bear on syntactic theory.},

We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

  title = {Categorical {{Models}} of {{Meaning}} : {{Accommodating}} for {{Lexical Ambiguity}} and {{Entailment}}},
  abstract = {The categorical compositional distributional model of Coecke, Sadrzadeh and Clark combines the distributional theory of meaning in terms of vectors space models, and the compositional model of meaning in terms of pregroup gram- mars, in a unified categorical setting. It provides a way of computing the meaning of sentences and strings of words based on the grammatical relation- ships between the different constituents, and the empirical meaning vectors of individual words: the grammatical reductions of pregroups are lifted to mor- phisms in vector spaces. This is based on the fact that pregroup grammars and vector spaces share a compact-closed structure. In the aim of modeling a feature of language, this framework was extended to include mixed states by the means of Selinger's CPM-construction. This translates into the passage from vectors to density matrices. Two applications of this extension are modelling lexical ambiguity, and modelling entailment relationships between words. The aim of this dissertation is to further extend the model of Coecke et al. by iterating the CPM-construction in order to accommodate for two features of language: ambiguity and entailment. We present an axiomatisation of the CPM2-construction and generalise it to axiomatise the CPMn-construction \textendash{} which has the potential to accommodate for an increasing number of features. The CPM2-construction preserves \textdagger{}-compact closed structure, and ensures that the grammatical reductions are carried over to the new category. We then study the structure of double-density matrices, new states introduced by the CPM2-construction, and investigate their role in accounting for both lexical ambiguity and entailment. This framework is showed to successfully model the two features of language via a series of examples, and is equipped with independent measures of the levels of ambiguity and entailment in words.},

Concept representations that are built using geometric and topological conceptual space structures are well suited for semantic similarity and concept combination operations. In addition, concepts that are more closely grounded in the physical world, such as many spatial concepts, have a natural fit with the geometric structure of conceptual spaces. Despite these apparent advantages, conceptual spaces are underutilized because existing formalizations of conceptual space theory have focused on individual aspects of the theory rather than the creation of a comprehensive algebra. In this paper we present a metric conceptual space algebra that is designed to facilitate the creation of conceptual space knowledge bases and inferencing systems. Conceptual regions are represented as convex polytopes and context is built in as a fundamental element. We demonstrate the applicability of the algebra to spatial information systems with a proof-of-concept application.},

  abstract = {We use the mathematical language of sheaf theory to give a unified treatment of non-locality and contextuality, in a setting which generalizes the familiar probability tables used in non-locality theory to arbitrary measurement covers; this includes Kochen-Specker configurations and more. We show that contextuality, and non-locality as a special case, correspond exactly to obstructions to the existence of global sections. We describe a linear algebraic approach to computing these obstructions, which allows a systematic treatment of arguments for non-locality and contextuality. We distinguish a proper hierarchy of strengths of no-go theorems, and show that three leading examples --- due to Bell, Hardy, and Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, respectively --- occupy successively higher levels of this hierarchy. A general correspondence is shown between the existence of local hidden-variable realizations using negative probabilities, and no-signalling; this is based on a result showing that the linear subspaces generated by the non-contextual and no-signalling models, over an arbitrary measurement cover, coincide. Maximal non-locality is generalized to maximal contextuality, and characterized in purely qualitative terms, as the non-existence of global sections in the support. A general setting is developed for Kochen-Specker type results, as generic, model-independent proofs of maximal contextuality, and a new combinatorial condition is given, which generalizes the `parity proofs' commonly found in the literature. We also show how our abstract setting can be represented in quantum mechanics. This leads to a strengthening of the usual no-signalling theorem, which shows that quantum mechanics obeys no-signalling for arbitrary families of commuting observables, not just those represented on different factors of a tensor product.},

  abstract = {A certain class of Frobenius algebras has been used to characterize orthonormal bases and observables on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. The presence of units in these algebras means that they can only be realized finite-dimensionally. We seek a suitable generalization, which will allow arbitrary bases and observables to be described within categorical axiomatizations of quantum mechanics. We develop a definition of H*-algebra that can be interpreted in any symmetric monoidal dagger category, reduces to the classical notion from functional analysis in the category of (possibly infinite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces, and hence provides a categorical way to speak about orthonormal bases and quantum observables in arbitrary dimension. Moreover, these algebras reduce to the usual notion of Frobenius algebra in compact categories. We then investigate the relations between nonunital Frobenius algebras and H*-algebras. We give a number of equivalent conditions to characterize when they coincide in the category of Hilbert spaces. We also show that they always coincide in categories of generalized relations and positive matrices.},

The models obtained with our construction possess many of the familiar structures used in Categorical Quantum Mechanics. We also provide a bestiary of increasingly exotic examples: some well known, such as real quantum theory and relational quantum theory; some less known, such as hyperbolic quantum theory, p-adic quantum theory and "parity quantum theory"; and some entirely new, such as "finite-field quantum theory" and "tropical quantum theory". As a further bonus, the measurement scenarios arising within these theories can be studied using the sheaf-theoretic framework for non-locality and contextuality. Their computational complexity can similarly be studied within existing frameworks for affine and unitary circuits over commutative semirings.},

An open game represents a game played relative to an arbitrary environment and to this end we introduce the concept of coutility, which is the utility generated by an open game and returned to its environment. Open games are the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category and can therefore be composed by categorical composition into sequential move games and by monoidal products into simultaneous move games. Open games can be represented by string diagrams which provide an intuitive but formal visualisation of the information flows. We show that a variety of games can be faithfully represented as open games in the sense of having the same Nash equilibria and off-equilibrium best responses.},

  title = {The {{Span Construction Interpretations}} and {{Applications}}},
  abstract = {The compositional distributional account models meaning of sentences relying on their grammatical structure to guide semantic composition. It has been successfully applied to the theory of conceptual spaces for cognition in [7], using convex algebras that describe the important convex structure of natural concepts. In the literature, metric spaces are also widely used to characterise conceptual spaces, however, they do not have the necessary structure as a category, compact closedness, to fit into the compositional distributional account. There are several alternatives to build a compact closed category from a given one and, in particular, this dissertation investigates the so-called span construction. Various interpretations and applications, including those in the cognition and linguistics setting, are analysed for spans of sets and metric spaces. A model for path composition is first explored to introduce the most important characteristics of this construction. Later, an interpretation for cognition to describe hyper-conceptual spaces results in applications for the phenomena of categorical perception or concept correlation. As a side effect, a connection with algebra of bags is explored and an enrichment over commutative monoids for span categories arises from this setting. To conclude, it is found that spans of metric spaces are suitable to model several aspects in cognitive science and they have applications in other areas such as algebra of bags.},

Despite this lack, when retested on the matching tasks used by Gordon, Pirah\~a speakers were able to perform exact matches with large numbers of objects perfectly but, as previously reported, they were inaccurate on matching tasks involving memory. These results suggest that language for exact number is a cultural invention rather than a linguistic universal, and that number words do not change our underlying representations of number but instead are a cognitive technology for keeping track of the cardinality of large sets across time, space, and changes in modality. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Herein we develop category-theoretic tools for understanding network-style diagrammatic languages. The archetypal network-style diagrammatic language is that of electric circuits; other examples include signal flow graphs, Markov processes, automata, Petri nets, chemical reaction networks, and so on. The key feature is that the language is comprised of a number of components with multiple (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type, that may then be connected together along these terminals to form a larger network. The components form hyperedges between labelled vertices, and so a diagram in this language forms a hypergraph. We formalise the compositional structure by introducing the notion of a hypergraph category. Network-style diagrammatic languages and their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic interpretation gives a hypergraph functor.
The first part of this thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories. In particular, we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations. Decorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph categories from diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and their composition are modelled by the cospans, while the 'decorations' specify the components themselves. Not all hypergraph categories can be constructed, however, through decorated cospans. Decorated corelations are a more powerful version that permits construction of all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors. These are often useful for constructing the semantic categories of diagrammatic languages and functors from diagrams to the semantics. To illustrate these principles, the second part of this thesis details applications to linear time-invariant dynamical systems and passive linear networks.},

  abstract = {Analytical Mechanics is the investigation of motion with the rigorous tools of mathematics. Rooted in the works of Lagrange, Euler, Poincar\'e (to mention just a few), it is a very classical subject with fascinating developments and still rich of open problems. It addresses such fundamental questions as: Is the solar system stable? Is there a unifying 'economy' principle in mechanics? How can a point mass be described as a 'wave'? And has remarkable applications to many branches of physics (Astronomy, Statistical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics). This book was written to fill a gap between elementary expositions and more advanced (and clearly more stimulating) material. It takes up the challenge to explain the most relevant ideas (generally highly non-trivial) and to show the most important applications using a plain language and 'simple' mathematics, often through an original approach. Basic calculus is enough for the reader to proceed through the book. New mathematical concepts are fully introduced and illustrated in a simple, student-friendly language. More advanced chapters can be omitted while still following the main ideas. Anybody wishing to go deeper in some direction will find at least the flavour of recent developments and many bibliographical references. The theory is always accompanied by examples. Many problems are suggested and some are completely worked out at the end of each chapter. The book may effectively be used (and has been used at several Italian Universities) for undergraduate as well as for PhD courses in Physics and Mathematics at various levels.},

Each volume is self-contained and is accessible to graduate students with a good background in mathematics. Volume 1 is devoted to general concepts. After introducing the terminology and proving the fundamental results concerning limits, adjoint functors and Kan extensions, the categories of fractions are studied in detail; special consideration is paid to the case of localizations. The remainder of the first volume studies various "refinements" of the fundamental concepts of category and functor.},

I have avoided use of this larger term here, since it tends to obscure the distinction between the language family and the language itself. This decision also reflects the preferences of most Brazilian linguists.
Although tentative classifications have placed the Mura family in the
Macro-Chibcha phylum, these seem to be poorly motivated; and I would,
therefore prefer to reserve judgments on genetic affiliation, considering the Mura family to be still unclassified.},

It's as essential to survival as fire - and, like fire, is found in all human societies. Language presents the bold and controversial idea that language is not an innate component of the brain, as has been famously argued by Chomsky and Pinker. Rather, it's a cultural tool which varies much more across different societies than the innateness view suggests. Fusing adventure, anthropology, linguistics and psychology, and drawing on Everett's pioneering research with the Amazonian Pirah\~as, Language argues that language is embedded within - and is inseparable from - its specific culture.

This constraint explains a number of very surprising features of Piraha grammar and culture: the absence of numbers of any kind or a concept of counting and of any terms for quantification, the absence of color terms, the absence of embedding, the simplest pronoun inventory known, the absence of ``relative tenses,'' the simplest kinship system yet documented, the absence of creation myths and fiction, the absence of any individual or collective memory of more than two generations past, the absence of drawing or other art and one of the simplest material cultures documented, and the fact that the Piraha are monolingual after more than 200 years of regular contact with Brazilians and the Tupi-Guarani-speaking Kawahiv.},

  shorttitle = {Categories in Control},
  abstract = {Control theory uses `signal-flow diagrams' to describe processes where real-valued functions of time are added, multiplied by scalars, differentiated and integrated, duplicated and deleted. These diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the PROP FinRel\_k, the strict version of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field of rational functions k = R(s) and linear relations, where the variable s acts as differentiation and the monoidal structure is direct sum rather than the usual tensor product of vector spaces. Control processes are also described by controllability and observability---whether the input can drive the process to any state, and whether any state can be determined from later outputs. For any field k we give a presentation of FinRel\_k in terms of generators of the free PROP of signal-flow diagrams together with the equations that give FinRel\_k its structure. The `cap' and `cup' generators, missing when the morphisms are linear maps, make it possible to model feedback. The relations say, among other things, that the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative dagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either one and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a bimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum, is familiar from the `ZX-calculus' obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with two mutually unbiased bases. In order to address controllability and observability, we construct the PROP Stateful\_k and relate it back to the PROP of signal-flow diagrams. This provides a way to graphically express controllability and observability for linear time-invariant processes.},

Declarative programming techniques, where algorithms are derived from a specification of the desired behavior, offer hope to address this problem, since there is a combinatorial reduction in complexity in programming in terms of specifications instead of algorithms, and arbitrary desired properties can be expressed and enforced in specifications directly. However, limitations on performance have prevented programming with declarative specifications from becoming a mainstream technique for general-purpose programming. To address the performance bottleneck in deriving an algorithm from a specification, I propose information-gain computation, a framework where an adaptive evaluation strategy is used to efficiently perform a search which derives algorithms that provide information about a query most directly. Within this framework, opportunities to compress the search space present themselves, which suggest that information-theoretic bounds on the performance of such a system might be articulated and a system designed to achieve them. In a preliminary empirical study of adaptive evaluation for a simple test program, the evaluation strategy adapts successfully to evaluate a query efficiently.},

Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a promising approach to GUI design. This thesis presents Elm, a concurrent FRP language focused on easily creating responsive GUIs. Elm has two major features: (1) purely functional graphical layout and (2) support for Concurrent FRP. Purely functional graphical layout is a high level framework for working with complex visual com- ponents. It makes it quick and easy to create and combine text, images, and video into rich multimedia displays. Concurrent FRP solves some of FRP's long-standing efficiency problems: global delays and needless recomputation. Together, Elm's two major features simplify the complicated task of creating responsive and usable graphical user interfaces. This thesis also includes a fully functional compiler for Elm, available at elm-lang.org.

  abstract = {Process theories combine a graphical language for compositional reasoning with an underlying categorical semantics. They have been successfully applied to fields such as quantum computation, natural language processing, linear dynamical systems and network theory. When investigating a new application, the question arises of how to identify a suitable process theoretic model. We present a conceptually motivated parameterized framework for the construction of models for process theories. Our framework generalizes the notion of binary relation along four axes of variation, the truth values, a choice of algebraic structure, the ambient mathematical universe and the choice of proof relevance or provability. The resulting categories are preorder-enriched and provide analogues of relational converse and taking graphs of maps. Our constructions are functorial in the parameter choices, establishing mathematical connections between different application domains. We illustrate our techniques by constructing many existing models from the literature, and new models that open up ground for further development.},

  abstract = {We propose a mathematical framework for a unification of the distributional theory of meaning in terms of vector space models, and a compositional theory for grammatical types, for which we rely on the algebra of Pregroups, introduced by Lambek. This mathematical framework enables us to compute the meaning of a well-typed sentence from the meanings of its constituents. Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are `lifted' to morphisms in a category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which exposes howthe information flows between the words in a sentence in order to make up the meaning of the whole sentence. A variation of our `categorical model' which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the semiring of Booleans results in a Montague-style Boolean-valued semantics.},

The introductory chapter explores elements of category theory, including limits and colimits, functors, adjunctions, Cartesian closed categories, and Galois connections. Succeeding chapters examine the concept of topos, local set theories, fundamental properties of toposes, sheaves, locale-valued sets, and natural and real numbers in local set theories.

The Facial Action Coding System (Ekman \& Friesen, 1978) is an objective method for quantifying facial movement in terms of component actions. We applied computer image analysis to the problem of automatically detecting facial actions in sequences of images. Three approaches were compared: holistic spatial analysis, explicit measurement of features such as wrinkles, and estimation of motion flow fields. The three methods were combined in a hybrid system that classified six upper facial actions with 91\% accuracy. The hybrid system outperformed human nonexperts on this task and performed as well as highly trained experts. An automated system would make facial expression measurement more widely accessible as a research tool in behavioral science and investigations of the neural substrates of emotion.},

  abstract = {The categorical compositional distributional model of natural language provides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of sentences, given grammatical structure and the meanings of its words. This approach has outperformed other models in mainstream empirical language processing tasks. However, until recently it has lacked the crucial feature of lexical entailment -- as do other distributional models of meaning. In this paper we solve the problem of entailment for categorical compositional distributional semantics. Taking advantage of the abstract categorical framework allows us to vary our choice of model. This enables the introduction of a notion of entailment, exploiting ideas from the categorical semantics of partial knowledge in quantum computation. The new model of language uses density matrices, on which we introduce a novel robust graded order capturing the entailment strength between concepts. This graded measure emerges from a general framework for approximate entailment, induced by any commutative monoid. Quantum logic embeds in our graded order. Our main theorem shows that entailment strength lifts compositionally to the sentence level, giving a lower bound on sentence entailment. We describe the essential properties of graded entailment such as continuity, and provide a procedure for calculating entailment strength.},

One can build up a Markov process from smaller open pieces. This process is formalized by making open Markov processes into the morphisms of a dagger compact category. We show that the behavior of a detailed balanced open Markov process is determined by a principle of minimum dissipation, closely related to Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy production. Using this fact, we set up a functor mapping open detailed balanced Markov processes to open circuits made of linear resistors. We also describe how to "black box" an open Markov process, obtaining the linear relation between input and output data that holds in any steady state, including nonequilibrium steady states with a nonzero flow of probability through the system. We prove that black boxing gives a symmetric monoidal dagger functor sending open detailed balanced Markov processes to Lagrangian relations between symplectic vector spaces. This allows us to compute the steady state behavior of an open detailed balanced Markov process from the behaviors of smaller pieces from which it is built. We relate this black box functor to a previously constructed black box functor for circuits.},

We describe a category where a morphism is a circuit of this sort with marked input and output terminals. In this category, composition describes the process of attaching the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another. We construct a functor, dubbed the "black box functor", that takes a circuit, forgets its internal structure, and remembers only its external behavior. Two circuits have the same external behavior if and only if they impose same relation between currents and potentials at their terminals. The space of these currents and potentials naturally has the structure of a symplectic vector space, and the relation imposed by a circuit is a Lagrangian linear relation. Thus, the black box functor goes from our category of circuits to the category of symplectic vector spaces and Lagrangian linear relations. We prove that this functor is a symmetric monoidal dagger functor between dagger compact categories. We assume the reader has some familiarity with category theory, but none with circuit theory or symplectic linear algebra.},

These diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the symmetric monoidal category FinVect\_k of finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field of rational functions k = R(s), where the variable s acts as differentiation and the monoidal structure is direct sum rather than the usual tensor product of vector spaces. For any field k we give a presentation of FinVect\_k in terms of the generators used in signal flow diagrams. A broader class of signal-flow diagrams also includes "caps" and "cups" to model feedback. We show these diagrams can be seen as string diagrams for the symmetric monoidal category FinRel\_k, where objects are still finite-dimensional vector spaces but the morphisms are linear relations. We also give a presentation for FinRel\_k. The relations say, among other things, that the 1-dimensional vector space k has two special commutative dagger-Frobenius structures, such that the multiplication and unit of either one and the comultiplication and counit of the other fit together to form a bimonoid. This sort of structure, but with tensor product replacing direct sum, is familiar from the "ZX-calculus" obeyed by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with two mutually unbiased bases.},

While reaction networks are mainly studied by chemists, they are equivalent to Petri nets, which are used for similar purposes in computer science and biology. As noted by Doi and others, techniques from quantum field theory can be adapted to apply to such systems. Here we use these techniques to study how the "master equation" describing stochastic time evolution for a reaction network is related to the "rate equation" describing the deterministic evolution of the expected number of particles of each species in the large-number limit. We show that the relation is especially strong when a solution of master equation is a "coherent state", meaning that the numbers of entities of each kind are described by independent Poisson distributions.},

In chemistry, where the reactions are assigned "rate constants", any reaction network gives rise to a nonlinear dynamical system called its "rate equation". Here we generalize these ideas to "open" reaction networks, which allow entities to flow in and out at certain designated inputs and outputs. We treat open reaction networks as morphisms in a category. Composing two such morphisms connects the outputs of the first to the inputs of the second. We construct a functor sending any open reaction network to its corresponding "open dynamical system". This provides a compositional framework for studying the dynamics of reaction networks. We then turn to statics: that is, steady state solutions of open dynamical systems. We construct a "black-boxing" functor that sends any open dynamical system to the relation that it imposes between input and output variables in steady states. This extends our earlier work on black-boxing for Markov processes.},

  abstract = {Questions the metric and dimensional assumptions that underlie the geometric representation of similarity on both theoretical and empirical grounds. A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance.},

  title = {The {{Behavior}} of {{Organisms}} : An {{Experimental Analysis}}},
  abstract = {Skinner outlines a science of behavior which generates its own laws through an analysis of its own data rather than securing them by reference to a conceptual neural process. "It is toward the reduction of seemingly diverse processes to simple laws that a science of behavior naturally directs itself. At the present time I know of no simplification of behavior that can be claimed for a neurological fact. Increasingly greater simplicity is being achieved, but through a systematic treatment of behavior at its own level." The results of behavior studies set problems for neurology, and in some cases constitute the sole factual basis for neurological constructs. The system developed in the present book is objective and descriptive. Behavior is regarded as either respondent or operant. Respondent behavior is elicited by observable stimuli, and classical conditioning has utilized this type of response. In the case of operant behavior no correlated stimulus can be detected when the behavior occurs. The factual part of the book deals largely with this behavior as studied by the author in extensive researches on the feeding responses of rats. The conditioning of such responses is compared with the stimulus conditioning of Pavlov. Particular emphasis is placed on the concept of "reflex reserve," a process which is built up during conditioning and exhausted during extinction, and on the concept of reflex strength. The chapter headings are as follows: a system of behavior; scope and method; conditioning and extinction; discrimination of a stimulus; some functions of stimuli; temporal discrimination of the stimulus; the differentiation of a response; drive; drive and conditioning; other variables affecting reflex strength; behavior and the nervous system; and conclusion.},

This requires a theory of semicategories enriched in the quantaloid \textbackslash{}mathcal\{Q\} , that admit a suitable Cauchy completion. There is a quantaloid \textbackslash{}mathsf\{Idl\}(\textbackslash{}mathcal\{Q\}) of \textbackslash{}mathcal\{Q\} -orders and ideal relations, and a locally ordered category \textbackslash{}mathsf\{Ord\}(\textbackslash{}mathcal\{Q\}) of \textbackslash{}mathcal\{Q\} -orders and monotone maps; actually, \textbackslash{}mathsf\{Ord\}(\textbackslash{}mathcal\{Q\})=\textbackslash{}mathsf\{Map\}(\textbackslash{}mathsf\{Idl\}(\textbackslash{}mathcal\{Q\})) . In particular is \textbackslash{}mathsf\{Ord\}(\textbackslash{}Omega) , with {$\Omega$} a locale, the category of ordered objects in the topos of sheaves on {$\Omega$}. In general \textbackslash{}mathcal\{Q\} -orders can equivalently be described as Cauchy complete categories enriched in the split-idempotent completion of \textbackslash{}mathcal\{Q\} . Applied to a locale {$\Omega$} this generalizes and unifies previous treatments of (ordered) sheaves on {$\Omega$} in terms of {$\Omega$}-enriched structures.},

Words, contexts, and senses are represented in Word Space, a high-dimensional, real-valued space in which closeness corresponds to semantic similarity. Similarity in Word Space is based on second-order co-occurrence: two tokens (or contexts) of the ambiguous worn are assigned to the same sense cluster if the words they co-occur with in turn occur with similar words in a training corpus. The algorithm is automatic and unsupervised in both training and application: senses are induced from re corpus without labeled training instances or other external knowledge sources.

The present study evaluated the reliability of these measures. Observational data came from three independent laboratory studies designed to elicit a wide range of spontaneous expressions of emotion. Emotion challenges included olfactory stimulation, social stress, and cues related to nicotine craving. Facial behavior was video-recorded and independently scored by two FACS-certified coders.

other members of the category and least attributes in common with other categories.

In Experiments 1 and 3, subjects listed attributes for members of semantic categories which had been previously rated for degree of prototypicality. High positive correlations were obtained between those ratings and the extent of distribution of an item's attributes among the other items of the category. In Experiments 2 and 4, subjects listed superordinates of category members and listed attributes of members of contrasting
categories. Negative correlations were obtained between prototypicality and superordinates other than the category in question and between prototypicality and an item's possession of attributes possessed by members of contrasting categories. Experiments 5 and 6 used artificial categories and showed that family resemblance within categories and lack of overlap of elements with contrasting categories were correlated with ease of learning, reaction time in identifying an item after learning, and rating of prototypicality of an item. It is argued that family resemblance offers an alternative to criterial features in defining categories.},

The new approach continues to emphasize the role of properties and their associations in conceptual representation, and to recognize the importance of similarity judgments in reasoning tasks. In the new theory, domains are sets equipped with a measure, and a property is a measurable membership function on a domain. Concepts are sets of properties and their binary associations. A new notion of the degree of ambiguity of properties for a given reasoning task is used to focus attention upon properties having the greatest discrimination power. The theory is demonstrated on a maritime application involving the categorization of vessel routes.},

  abstract = {The reachability semantics for Petri nets can be studied using open Petri nets. For us an 'open' Petri net is one with certain places designated as inputs and outputs via a cospan of sets. We can compose open Petri nets by gluing the outputs of one to the inputs of another. Open Petri nets can be treated as morphisms of a category, which becomes symmetric monoidal under disjoint union. However, since the composite of open Petri nets is defined only up to isomorphism, it is better to treat them as morphisms of a symmetric monoidal double category \$\textbackslash{}mathbb\{O\}\textbackslash{}mathbf\{pen\}(\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Petri\})\$. Various choices of semantics for open Petri nets can be described using symmetric monoidal double functors out of \$\textbackslash{}mathbb\{O\}\textbackslash{}mathbf\{pen\}(\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Petri\})\$. Here we describe the reachability semantics, which assigns to each open Petri net the relation saying which markings of the outputs can be obtained from a given marking of the inputs via a sequence of transitions. We show this semantics gives a symmetric monoidal lax double functor from \$\textbackslash{}mathbb\{O\}\textbackslash{}mathbf\{pen\}(\textbackslash{}mathrm\{Petri\})\$ to the double category of relations. A key step in the proof is to treat Petri nets as presentations of symmetric monoidal categories; for this we use the work of Meseguer, Montanari, Sassone and others.},

An atomic swap protocol guarantees (1) if all parties conform to the protocol, then all swaps take place, (2) if some coalition deviates from the protocol, then no conforming party ends up worse off, and (3) no coalition has an incentive to deviate from the protocol. A cross-chain swap is modeled as a directed graph \$\{\textbackslash{}cal D\}\$, whose vertexes are parties and whose arcs are proposed asset transfers. For any pair \$(\{\textbackslash{}cal D\},L)\$, where \$\{\textbackslash{}cal D\} = (V,A)\$ is a strongly-connected directed graph and \$L \textbackslash{}subset V\$ a feedback vertex set for \$\{\textbackslash{}cal D\}\$, we give an atomic cross-chain swap protocol for \$\{\textbackslash{}cal D\}\$, using a form of hashed timelock contracts, where the vertexes in \$L\$ generate the hashlocked secrets. We show that no such protocol is possible if \$\{\textbackslash{}cal D\}\$ is not strongly connected, or if \$\{\textbackslash{}cal D\}\$ is strongly connected but \$L\$ is not a feedback vertex set. The protocol has time complexity \$O(diam(\{\textbackslash{}cal D\}))\$ and space complexity (bits stored on all blockchains) \$O(|A|\^2)\$.},

The encoding preserves strong and weak CCS asynchronous bisimilarities: it thus represents a relevant step in establishing a precise correspondence between asynchronous calculi and (open) Petri nets. The work is intended as fostering the technology transfer between these formalisms: as an example, we discuss how some results on expressiveness can be transferred from the calculus to nets and back.},

It turns out that EOS are equivalent to counter programs. But even for the restricted subclass of conservative EOS reachability and liveness are undecidable problems. On the other hand for other properties like boundedness are still decidable for conservative EOS. We also study the sub-class of generalised state machines, which is worth mentioning since it combines decidability of many theoretically interesting properties with a quite rich practical modelling expressiveness.},

The existence of the solution sought is established via a simple graph-theoretic argument with an inefficiently constructive proof; for example, PLS can be thought of as corresponding to the lemma "every dag has a sink." The new classes are based on lemmata such as "every graph has an even number of odd-degree nodes." They contain several important problems for which no polynomial time algorithm is presently known, including the computational versions of Sperner's lemma, Brouwer's fixpoint theorem, Chevalley's theorem, and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem, the linear complementarity problem for P-matrices, finding a mixed equilibrium in a non-zero sum game, finding a second Hamilton circuit in a Hamiltonian cubic graph, a second Hamiltonian decomposition in a quartic graph, and others.

This book develops the theory and practice of signal processing systems for these situations that extract useful, qualitative information using the mathematics of topology -- the study of spaces under continuous transformations. Since the collection of continuous transformations is large and varied, tools which are topologically-motivated are automatically insensitive to substantial distortion.

Their bisimulation relies on a modified transition system where, at any moment, a process can perform any input action. In this paper we propose a new notion of bisimulation for the asynchronous -calculus, defined on top of the standard labelled transition system. We give several characterizations of this equivalence including one in terms of Honda and Tokoro's bisimulation, and one in terms of barbed equivalence. We show that this bisimulation is preserved by name substitutions, hence by input prefix. Finally, we give a complete axiomatization of the (strong) bisimulation for finite terms.},

The presentation is unifies by casting the models in an categorytheoretic framework. One aim is to use category theory to provide abstract characterisations of constructions like parallel composition valid throughout a range of different models and use adjunctions to provide formal means for translating between different models. A knowledge of basic category theory is assumed, up to an acquaintance with the notion of adjunction.},

Simplicity also includes operational semantics that are defined with an abstract machine that we call the Bit Machine. The Bit Ma- chine is used as a tool for measuring the computational space and time resources needed to evaluate Simplicity programs. Owing to its Turing incompleteness, Simplicity is amenable to static analysis that can be used to derive upper bounds on the computational resources needed, prior to execution. While Turing incomplete, Simplicity can express any finitary function, which we believe is enough to build useful ``smart contracts'' for blockchain applications.},

We argue against each of these claims. Relying on the available documentation and descriptions of the language, especially the rich material in Everett 1986, 1987b, we argue that many of the exceptional grammatical 'gaps' supposedly characteristic of Pirah\~a are misanalyzed by Everett (2005) and are neither gaps nor exceptional among the world's languages. We find no evidence, for example, that Pirah\~a lacks embedded clauses, and in fact find strong syntactic and semantic evidence in favor of their existence in Pirah\~a Likewise, we find no evidence that Pirah\~a lacks quantifiers, as claimed by Everett (2005). Furthermore, most of the actual properties of the Pirah\~a constructions discussed by Everett (for example, the ban on prenominal possessor recursion and the behavior of WH -constructions) are familiar from languages whose speakers lack the cultural restrictions attributed to the Pirah\~a. Finally, following mostly Gon{\c c}alves (1993, 2000, 2001), we also question some of the empirical claims about Pirah\~a culture advanced by Everett in primary support of the 'immediate experience' restriction. We conclude that there is no evidence from Pirah\~a for the particular causal relation between culture and grammatical structure suggested by Everett.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

Glyn Morrill opens with the history and notation of Lambek Calculus and its application to syntax, semantics, and processing. Successive chapters extend the grammar to a number of significant syntactic and semantic properties of natural language. The final part applies Morrill's account to several current issues in processing and parsing, considered from both a psychological and a computational perspective. The book offers a rigorous and thoughtful study of one of the main lines of research in the formal and mathematical theory of grammar, and will be suitable for students of linguistics and cognitive science from advanced undergraduate level upwards.},

Communication between the two families is implemented in terms of linear distributivity principles. The aim of this paper is to complement the symmetry between (dual) residuated type-forming operations with an orthogonal opposition that contrasts residuated and Galois connected operations. Whereas the (dual) residuated operations are monotone, the Galois connected operations (and their duals) are antitone. We discuss the algebraic properties of the (dual) Galois connected operations, and generalize the (co)product distributivity principles to include the negative operations. We give a continuation-passing-style translation for the new type-forming operations, and discuss some linguistic applications.},

  abstract = {Mixed states are of interest in quantum mechanics for modelling partial information. More recently categorical approaches to linguistics have also exploited the idea of mixed states to describe ambiguity and hyponym / hypernym relationships. In both these application areas the category Rel of sets and binary relations is often used as an alternative model. Selinger's CPM construction provides the setting for mixed states in Hilbert space based categorical quantum mechanics. By analogy, applying the CPM construction to Rel is seen as introducing mixing into a relational setting. We investigate the category CPM(Rel) of completely positive maps in Rel. We show that the states of an object in CPM(Rel) are in bijective correspondence with certain families of graphs. Via map-state duality this then allows us provide a graph theoretic characterization of the morphisms in CPM(Rel). By identifying an appropriate composition operation on graphs, we then show that CPM(Rel) is isomorphic to a category of sets and graphs between them. This isomorphism then leads to a graph based description of the complete join semilattice enriched dagger compact structure of CPM(Rel). These results allow us to reason about CPM(Rel) entirely in terms of graphs. We exploit these techniques in several examples. We give a closed form expression for the number of states of a finite set in CPM(Rel). The pure states are characterized in graph theoretic terms. We also demonstrate the possibly surprising phenomenon of a pure state that can be given as a mixture of two mixed states.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, category theory has widened its scope and now inter\-acts with many areas of mathematics. This book develops some of the interactions between universal algebra and category theory as well as some of the resulting applications. We begin with an exposition of equationally defineable classes from the point of view of "algebraic theories", but without the use of category theory. This serves to motivate the general treatment of algebraic theories in a category, which is the central concern of the book. (No category theory is presumed; rather, an independent treatment is provided by the second chap\- ter.) Applications abound throughout the text and exercises and in the final chapter in which we pursue problems originating in topological dynamics and in automata theory. This book is a natural outgrowth of the ideas of a small group of mathematicians, many of whom were in residence at the Forschungsinstitut f\"ur Mathematik of the Eidgen\"ossische Technische Hochschule in Z\"urich, Switzerland during the academic year 1966-67. It was in this stimulating atmosphere that the author wrote his doctoral dissertation. The "Z\"urich School," then, was Michael Barr, Jon Beck, John Gray, Bill Lawvere, Fred Linton, and Myles Tierney (who were there) and (at least) Harry Appelgate, Sammy Eilenberg, John Isbell, and Saunders Mac Lane (whose spiritual presence was tangible).

I have profited from discussions of philosophical issues with J. L. Corcoran, Philip Kitcher, Leo? nard Linsky, Penelope Maddy, W. V. Quine, Michael Resnik, and Howard Stein. Some of my earlier views on various issues have been constructively examined by Joel Fingerman, Marvin J. Greenberg, Nicholas Goodman, P. C. Kolaitis, J. R. Shoenfield, and David Stroh. I am grateful to all those people-and to a number of others-even in the numerous cases where I have not followed their advice.},

Much confusion has arisen in the past through a neglect of the develop ment of Leibniz's ideas, and Couturat's impressive plea, in his edition of the Opuscu/es et fragments (p. xii), for such an arrangement is valid even for incomplete editions. The beginning student will do well, however, to read the maturer writings of Parts II, III, and IV first, leaving Part I, from a period too largely neglected by Leibniz criticism, for a later study of the still obscure sources and motives of his thought. The Introduction aims primarily to provide cultural orientation and an exposition of the structure and the underlying assumptions of the philosophical system rather than a critical evaluation. I hope that together with the notes and the Index, it will provide those aids to the understanding which the originality of Leibniz's scientific, ethical, and metaphysical efforts deserve.},

We study the applicability of multiparty session type (MPST) protocols for verification of actor programs. We incorporate sessions to actors by introducing minimum additions to the model such as the notion of actor roles and protocol mailboxes. The framework uses Scribble, which is a protocol description language based on multiparty session types. Our programming model supports actor-like syntax and runtime verification mechanism guaranteeing communication safety of the participating entities. An actor can implement multiple roles in a similar way as an object can implement multiple interfaces. Multiple roles allow for cooperative inter-concurrency in a single actor. We demonstrate our framework by designing and implementing a session actor library in Python and its runtime verification mechanism. Benchmark results demonstrate that the runtime checks induce negligible overhead. We evaluate the applicability of our verification framework to specify actor interactions by implementing twelve examples from an actor benchmark suit.},

  abstract = {A quite flourishing research thread in the recent literature on component-based systems is concerned with the algebraic properties of different classes of connectors. In a recent paper, an algebra of stateless connectors was presented that consists of five kinds of basic connectors, namely symmetry, synchronization, mutual exclusion, hiding and inaction, plus their duals, and it was shown how they can be freely composed in series and in parallel to model sophisticated 'glues'. In this paper we explore the expressiveness of stateful connectors obtained by adding one-place buffers or unbounded buffers to the stateless connectors. The main results are: i) we show how different classes of connectors exactly correspond to suitable classes of Petri nets equipped with compositional interfaces, called nets with boundaries; ii) we show that the difference between strong and weak semantics in stateful connectors is reflected in the semantics of nets with boundaries by moving from the classic step semantics (strong case) to a novel banking semantics (weak case), where a step can be executed by taking some 'debit' tokens to be given back during the same step; iii) we show that the corresponding bisimilarities are congruences (w.r.t. composition of connectors in series and in parallel); iv) we show that suitable monoidality laws, like those arising when representing stateful connectors in the tile model, can nicely capture concurrency (in the sense of step semantics) aspects; and v) as a side result, we provide a basic algebra, with a finite set of symbols, out of which we can compose all P/T nets with boundaries, fulfilling a long standing quest.},

Projective simulation is based on a random walk through a network of clips, which are elementary patches of episodic memory. The network of clips changes dynamically, both due to new perceptual input and due to certain compositional principles of the simulation process. During simulation, the clips are screened for specific features which trigger factual action of the agent. The scheme is different from other, computational, notions of simulation, and it provides a new element in an embodied cognitive science approach to intelligent action and learning. Our model provides a natural route for generalization to quantum-mechanical operation and connects the fields of reinforcement learning and quantum computation.},

Experiment 1 found that central tendency did not predict graded structure in goal-derived categories, although it did predict graded structure in common taxonomic categories. Ideals and frequency of instantiation predicted graded structure in both category types to sizeable and equal extents. A fourth possible determinant--familiarity--did not predict typicality in either common taxonomic or goal-derived categories. Experiment 2 demonstrated that both central tendency and ideals causally determine graded structure, and work showing that frequency causally determines graded structure is discussed. Experiment 2 also demonstrated that the determinants of a particular category's graded structure can change with context. Whereas ideals may determine a category's graded structure in one context, central tendency may determine a different graded structure in another. It is proposed that graded structures do not reflect invariant structures associated with categories but instead reflect people's dynamic ability to construct concepts.},

  abstract = {Compact closed categories have found applications in modeling quantum information protocols by Abramsky-Coecke. They also provide semantics for Lambek's pregroup algebras, applied to formalizing the grammatical structure of natural language, and are implicit in a distributional model of word meaning based on vector spaces. Specifically, in previous work Coecke-Clark-Sadrzadeh used the product category of pregroups with vector spaces and provided a distributional model of meaning for sentences. We recast this theory in terms of strongly monoidal functors and advance it via Frobenius algebras over vector spaces. The former are used to formalize topological quantum field theories by Atiyah and Baez-Dolan, and the latter are used to model classical data in quantum protocols by Coecke-Pavlovic-Vicary. The Frobenius algebras enable us to work in a single space in which meanings of words, phrases, and sentences of any structure live. Hence we can compare meanings of different language constructs and enhance the applicability of the theory. We report on experimental results on a number of language tasks and verify the theoretical predictions.},

It combines Barr's relational presentation of topological spaces in terms of ultrafilter convergence with Lawvere's interpretation of metric spaces as small categories enriched over the extended real half-line. Hence, equipped with a quantale V (replacing the reals) and a monad T (replacing the ultrafilter monad) laxly extended from set maps to V-valued relations, the book develops a categorical theory of (T,V)-algebras that is inspired simultaneously by its metric and topological roots. The book highlights in particular the distinguished role of equationally defined structures within the given lax-algebraic context and presents numerous new results ranging from topology and approach theory to domain theory. All the necessary pre-requisites in order and category theory are presented in the book.},

FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

Over a regular Mal'cev category, this correspondence gives a characterization of categories of completely positive maps, enabling the formulation of quantum features.

@thesis{Hedges2016,
  langid = {english},
  title = {Towards {{Compositional Game Theory}}},
  abstract = {We introduce a new foundation for game theory based on so-called open games. Unlike existing approaches open games are fully compositional: games are built using algebraic operations from standard components, such as players and outcome functions, with no fundamental distinction being made between the parts and the whole. Open games are intended to be applied at large scales where classical game theory becomes impractical to use, and this thesis therefore covers part of the theoretical foundation of a powerful new tool for economics and other subjects using game theory. Formally we define a symmetric monoidal category whose morphisms are open games, which can therefore be combined either sequentially using categorical composition, or simultaneously using the monoidal product. Using this structure we can also graphically represent open games using string diagrams. We prove that the new definitions give the same results (both equilibria and off-equilibrium best responses) as classical game theory in several important special cases: normal form games with pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria, and perfect information games with subgame perfect equilibria. This thesis also includes work on higher order game theory, a related but simpler approach to game theory that uses higher order functions to model players. This has been extensively developed by Martin Escard\textasciiacute{} o and Paulo Oliva for games of perfect information, and we extend it to normal form games. We show that this approach can be used to elegantly model coordination and differentiation goals of players. We also argue that a modification of the solution concept used by Escard\textasciiacute{} o and Oliva is more appropriate for such applications.},

The first covers Lie groups and Lie algebras and the relationship between them, along with basic representation theory. The second part covers the theory of semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras, beginning with a detailed analysis of the representations of SU(3). The author illustrates the general theory with numerous images pertaining to Lie algebras of rank two and rank three, including images of root systems, lattices of dominant integral weights, and weight diagrams.

We implement the abstract categorical model of Coecke et al. (arXiv:1003.4394v1 [cs.CL]) using data from the BNC and evaluate it. The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors in the first experiment, and betters them in the second. The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic complexity showcases the compositional power of our model.},

KURT GODEL This book is a compilation and development of lecture notes written for a course on nonstandard analysis that I have now taught several times. Students taking the course have typically received previous introductions to standard real analysis and abstract algebra, but few have studied formal logic. Most of the notes have been used several times in class and revised in the light of that experience. The earlier chapters could be used as the basis of a course at the upper undergraduate level, but the work as a whole, including the later applications, may be more suited to a beginning graduate course. This prefacedescribes my motivationsand objectives in writingthe book. For the most part, these remarks are addressed to the potential instructor. Mathematical understanding develops by a mysterious interplay between intuitive insight and symbolic manipulation. Nonstandard analysis requires an enhanced sensitivity to the particular symbolic form that is used to ex\- press our intuitions, and so the subject poses some unique and challenging pedagogical issues. The most fundamental ofthese is how to turn the trans\- fer principle into a working tool of mathematical practice. I have found it vi Preface unproductive to try to give a proof of this principle by introducing the formal Tarskian semantics for first-order languages and working through the proofofLos's theorem.},

  abstract = {Its finally here! In the fifth volume of the acclaimed Card College series, Roberto Giobbi has prepared a graduation party! In previous volumes the reader has been given a remarkable collection of tools for creating astonishing card magic. In the same vein, Volume 5 begins with a meaty chapter of new techniques and strategies, which include methods for covertly arranging stacks during performance, obtaining a duplicate of a spectators signature with his knowledge, and secretly conveying cards to and from the deck. Powerful tools indeed. But then Volume 5 diverges from the established Card College formula. Judging that the reader now has more than a sufficient number of tools in his grasp, Mr. Giobbi provides eight chapters filled with tricks and routines that illustrate how various techniques are applied to create world-class card magic. These effects, however, are not mere constructions meant for teaching. Most have been drawn from Roberto Giobbis professional repertoire and because of this even the classics of card magic are given a fresh gleam as Giobbi adds refinements won from years of performing experience. His choice of material is impeccable, featuring not only original effects and handlings of his own, but tricks and routines by world-masters as well. One finds such gems as Fred Kaps presentation for The Signed Card in Box, along with Giobbi's cunning treatment of this modern classic, Henry Christs fabulous Ace routine and a superb handling of a forgotten masterpiece by Charlie Miller. And everything is taught with the clarity and attention to detail for which the Card College series has become known. Open this book and welcome to the party - prepare to graduate!

It conforms the Church-Turing Thesis, and captures the same computable functions as the standard models. It provides a succinct categorical interface to most of them, free of their diverse implementation details, using the ideas and structures that in the meantime emerged from research in semantics of computation and programming. The salient feature of the language of monoidal categories is that it is supported by a sound and complete graphical formalism, string diagrams, which provide a concrete and intuitive interface for abstract reasoning about computation. The original motivation and the ultimate goal of this effort is to provide a convenient high level programming language for a theory of computational resources, such as one-way functions, and trapdoor functions, by adopting the methods for hiding the low level implementation details that emerged from practice. In the present paper, we make a first step towards this ambitious goal, and sketch a path to reach it. This path is pursued in three sequel papers, that are in preparation.},

In the present paper, we refine and extend that model of computation to support a formal complexity theory as well. This formalization brings to the foreground the concept of normal complexity measures, which allow decompositions akin to Kleene's normal form. Such measures turn out to be just those where evaluating the complexity of a program does not require substantially more resources than evaluating the program itself. The usual time and space complexity are thus normal measures, whereas the average and the randomized complexity measures are not. While the measures that are not normal provide important design time information about algorithms, and for theoretical analyses, normal measures can also be used at run time, as practical tools of computation, e.g. to set the bounds for hypothesis testing, inductive inference and algorithmic learning.},

  abstract = {Monoidal computer is a categorical model of intensional computation, where many different programs correspond to the same input-output behavior. The upshot of yet another model of computation is that a categorical formalism should provide a much needed high level language for theory of computation, flexible enough to allow abstracting away the low level implementation details when they are irrelevant, or taking them into account when they are genuinely needed. A salient feature of the approach through monoidal categories is the formal graphical language of string diagrams, which supports visual reasoning about programs and computations. In the present paper, we provide a coalgebraic characterization of monoidal computer. It turns out that the availability of interpreters and specializers, that make a monoidal category into a monoidal computer, is equivalent with the existence of a *universal state space*, that carries a weakly final state machine for any pair of input and output types. Being able to program state machines in monoidal computers allows us to represent Turing machines, to capture their execution, count their steps, as well as, e.g., the memory cells that they use. The coalgebraic view of monoidal computer thus provides a convenient diagrammatic language for studying computability and complexity.},

The mix of constructs found in BPMN makes it possible to create models with semantic errors. Such errors are especially serious, because errors in the early phases of systems development are among the most costly and hardest to correct. The ability to statically check the semantic correctness of models is thus a desirable feature for modelling tools based on BPMN. Accordingly, this paper proposes a mapping from BPMN to a formal language, namely Petri nets, for which efficient analysis techniques are available. The proposed mapping has been implemented as a tool that, in conjunction with existing Petri net-based tools, enables the static analysis of BPMN models. The formalisation also led to the identification of deficiencies in the BPMN standard specification.},

A framework for the modular encoding of process calculi into Petri nets is proposed, which is based on a reactive variant of Petri nets. In particular, two exemplary calculi are considered: (asynchronous) CCS and CSP, representing alternative interaction paradigms, namely asynchronous and (broadcast) synchronous communication. The encoding is proved to preserve as well as to reflect the operational semantics. As a consequence, it is well-behaved with respect to the standard behavioural equivalences, a fact that is exploited to perform a ``technology transfer'' between the two formalisms, in terms of un/decidability results for classical properties such as reachability and deadlock-freedom.},

  abstract = {This article shows how individual Petri nets form models of Girard's intuitionistic linear logic. It explores questions of expressiveness and completeness of linear logic with respect to this interpretation. An aim is to use Petri nets to give an understanding of linear logic and give some appraisal of the value of linear logic as a specification logic for Petri nets. This article might serve as a tutorial, providing one in-road into Girard's linear logic via Petri nets. With this in mind we have added several exercises and their solutions. We have made no attempt to be exhaustive in our treatment, dedicating our treatment to one semantics of intuitionistic linear logic.

Completeness is shown for several versions of Girard's linear logic with respect to Petri nets as the class of models. The strongest logic considered is intuitionistic linear logic, with {$\otimes$}, {$\multimap$}, \&, {$\oplus$} and the exponential ! (``of course''), and forms of quantification. This logic is shown sound and complete with respect to atomic nets (these include nets in which every transition leads to a nonempty multiset of places). The logic is remarkably expressive, enabling descriptions of the kinds of properties one might wish to show of nets; in particular, negative properties, asserting the impossibility of an assertion, can also be expressed. A start is made on decidability issues.},

  title = {Formal {{Barriers}} to {{Longest}}-{{Chain Proof}}-of-{{Stake Protocols}}},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06528},
  abstract = {The security of most existing cryptocurrencies is based on a concept called Proof-of-Work, in which users must solve a computationally hard cryptopuzzle to authorize transactions (`one unit of computation, one vote'). This leads to enormous expenditure on hardware and electricity in order to collect the rewards associated with transaction authorization. Proof-of-Stake is an alternative concept that instead selects users to authorize transactions proportional to their wealth (`one coin, one vote'). Some aspects of the two paradigms are the same. For instance, obtaining voting power in Proof-of-Stake has a monetary cost just as in Proof-of-Work: a coin cannot be freely duplicated any more easily than a unit of computation. However some aspects are fundamentally different. In particular, exactly because Proof-of-Stake is wasteless, there is no inherent resource cost to deviating (commonly referred to as the `Nothing-at-Stake' problem). In contrast to prior work, we focus on incentive-driven deviations (any participant will deviate if doing so yields higher revenue) instead of adversarial corruption (an adversary may take over a significant fraction of the network, but the remaining players follow the protocol). The main results of this paper are several formal barriers to designing incentive-compatible proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies (that don't apply to proof-of-work).},

  title = {High-Level Methods for Homotopy Construction in Associative n-Categories},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03831},
  abstract = {A combinatorial theory of associative \$n\$-categories has recently been proposed, with strictly associative and unital composition in all dimensions, and the weak structure arising as a combinatorial notion of homotopy with a natural geometrical interpretation. Such a theory has the potential to serve as an attractive foundation for a computer proof assistant for higher category theory, since it allows composites to be uniquely described, and relieves proofs from the bureaucracy of associators, unitors and their coherence. However, this basic theory lacks a high-level way to construct homotopies, which would be intractable to build directly in complex situations; it is not therefore immediately amenable to implementation. We tackle this problem by describing a contraction operation, which algorithmically constructs complex homotopies that reduce the lengths of composite terms. This contraction procedure allows building of nontrivial proofs by repeatedly contracting subterms, and also allows the contraction of those proofs themselves, yielding in some cases single-step witnesses for complex homotopies. We prove correctness of this procedure by showing that it lifts connected colimits from a base category to a category of zigzags, a procedure which is then iterated to yield a contraction mechanism in any dimension. We also present homotopy.io, an online proof assistant that implements the theory of associative \$n\$-categories, and use it to construct a range of examples that illustrate this new contraction mechanism.},

In the simplest way possible, Statebox can be seen as a clever way to tie together different theoretical structures to maximize their benefits and limit their downsides. Since consistency and correctness are central requisites for our language, it became clear from the beginning that such tying could not be achieved by just hacking together different pieces of code representing implementations of the structures we wanted to leverage: Rigorous mathematics is employed to ensure both conceptual consistency of the language and reliability of the code itself. The mathematics presented here is what guided the implementation process, and we deemed very useful to release it to the public to help people wanting to audit our work to better understand the code itself.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the pioneering work of Petri and the rise of diagrammatic formalisms to reason about networks of open systems, we introduce the resource calculus---a graphical language for distributed systems. Like process algebras, the resource calculus is modular, with primitive connectors from which all diagrams can be built. We characterise its equational theory by proving a full completeness result for an interpretation in the symmetric monoidal category of additive relations---a result that constitutes the main contribution of this thesis.

    Additive relations are frequently exploited by model-checking algorithms for Petri nets. In this thesis, we recognise them as a fundamental algebraic structure of concurrency and use them as an axiomatic framework. Surprisingly, the resource calculus has the same syntax as that of interacting Hopf algebras, a diagrammatic formalism for linear (time-invariant dynamical) systems. Indeed, the approach stems from the simple but fruitful realisation that, by replacing values in a field with values in the semiring of non-negative integers, concurrent behaviour patterns emerge. This change of model reflects the interpretation of diagrams as systems manipulating limited and discrete resources instead of continuous signals.

    We also extend the resource calculus in two orthogonal directions. First, by adding an affine primitive to express access to a constant quantity of resources. The extended calculus is remarkably expressive and allows the formulation of non-additive patterns of behaviour, like mutual exclusion. Once more, we characterise it---this time as the equational theory of the symmetric monoidal category of polyhedral relations, discrete analogues of polyhedra in convex geometry. Secondly, we add a synchronous register to model stateful systems. The stateful resource calculus is expressive enough to faithfully capture the behaviour of Petri nets while being strictly more expressive. It is also shown to axiomatise a category of open Petri nets, in the style of the connector algebras of nets with boundaries first studied by Bruni, Melgratti, Montanari and Soboci\'nski.},

  shorttitle = {Designing {{Secure Ethereum Smart Contracts}}},
  abstract = {The adoption of blockchain-based distributed computation platforms is growing fast. Some of these platforms, such as Ethereum, provide support for implementing smart contracts, which are envisioned to have novel applications in a broad range of areas, including finance and Internet-of-Things. However, a significant number of smart contracts deployed in practice suffer from security vulnerabilities, which enable malicious users to steal assets from a contract or to cause damage. Vulnerabilities present a serious issue since contracts may handle financial assets of considerable value, and contract bugs are non-fixable by design. To help developers create more secure smart contracts, we introduce FSolidM, a framework rooted in rigorous semantics for designing con- tracts as Finite State Machines (FSM). We present a tool for creating FSM on an easy-to-use graphical interface and for automatically generating Ethereum contracts. Further, we introduce a set of design patterns, which we implement as plugins that developers can easily add to their contracts to enhance security and functionality.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04282},
  abstract = {The prevalence of IoT devices makes them an ideal target for attackers. To reduce the risk of attacks vendors routinely deliver security updates (patches) for their devices. The delivery of security updates becomes challenging due to the issue of scalability as the number of devices may grow much quicker than vendors' distribution systems. Previous studies have suggested a permissionless and decentralized blockchain-based network in which nodes can host and deliver security updates, thus the addition of new nodes scales out the network. However, these studies do not provide an incentive for nodes to join the network, making it unlikely for nodes to freely contribute their hosting space, bandwidth, and computation resources. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized IoT software update delivery network in which participating nodes referred to as distributors) are compensated by vendors with digital currency for delivering updates to devices. Upon the release of a new security update, a vendor will make a commitment to provide digital currency to distributors that deliver the update; the commitment will be made with the use of smart contracts, and hence will be public, binding, and irreversible. The smart contract promises compensation to any distributor that provides proof-of-distribution, which is unforgeable proof that a single update was delivered to a single device. A distributor acquires the proof-of-distribution by exchanging a security update for a device signature using the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) trustless data exchange protocol. Eliminating the need for trust between the security update distributor and the security consumer (IoT device) by providing fair compensation, can significantly increase the number of distributors, thus facilitating rapid scale out.},
